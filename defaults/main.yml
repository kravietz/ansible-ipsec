# Master IPSec secret, used to securely generate unique pre-shared key for each host pair.
# This remains the same across all Ansible managed hosts. Use ansible-vault for secure storage.
# Use 'openssl rand -hex 60' to create new one
ipsec_secret: 'Your IPSec Secret'

# Values: 'use' or 'require'.
# 'use' is fail-open policy - if IPSec cannot be established, the traffic will flow unencrypted.
# 'require' is fail-close policy - not traffic will be allowed without IPSec.
# 'disable' - disable IPSec policies at all; can be used as a quick off switch
ipsec_policy: 'use'

# Values: 'ike' or 'setkey'
# 'ike' is the preferred keying mode with IKE daemon suitable for long-term production environments
# 'setkey' uses day-dependent static keys which is INSECURE in long term but may be suitable for
#   development environments with frequent Ansible build that will replace the keys
ipsec_mode: 'ike'

ipsec_open_icmp: yes
        
# No IPSec for SSH
ipsec_open_ssh: yes

# Create forwading SPD entries for Docker-like traffic
ipsec_forward: no

# Create SPD/SAD entries for which address families? These are Ansible variable names,
# but they are self-explanatory. Delete one if not required, but make sure it remains a list.
