# Values: 'use' or 'require'.
# 'use' is fail-open policy - if IPSec cannot be established, the traffic will flow unencrypted.
# 'require' is fail-close policy - not traffic will be allowed without IPSec.
# 'disable' - disable IPSec policies at all; can be used as a quick off switch
ipsec_policy: 'use'

# Values: 'ike' or 'setkey'
# 'ike' is the preferred keying mode with IKE daemon suitable for long-term production environments
# 'setkey' uses day-dependent static keys which is INSECURE in long term but may be suitable for
#   development environments with frequent Ansible build that will replace the keys

# Create SPD/SAD entries for which address families? These are Ansible variable names,
# but they are self-explanatory. Delete one if not required, but make sure it remains a list.
